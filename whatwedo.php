						<p class="article">From the first commercial and mining exploration missions back in 2079, shortly after the secrets of nuclear fusion were found, <strong>Erwan Degemer</strong> founded the <strong>Peran's Starfleet</strong>, inspired by the name of his son. 
						 With one small AIRBUS X450 in 2083, his freighting company is now a major international company, <strong>financing research vessels and expeditions</strong>. PRS acquired in 2090 its first communication tower and started <strong>Quantum</strong>, a wide-public 
						 telecommunication solution based on <strong>GAMA Network</strong>, created the same year. PRS now owns and finance 4 research vessels, allowing each year more than <strong>2600 students</strong> to do their research within our facilities.
